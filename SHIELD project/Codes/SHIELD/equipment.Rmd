## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}

library('dplyr')
library('ggplot2')
library('tidyverse')

```

```{r}

Equipment=read.csv(file.choose(), sep=",", header=T)

```

```{r}

  str(Equipment)
colnames(Equipment)

# changing column names

colnames(Equipment) <- c("Barcode", "ID", "Name", "Serial", "Type", "Lab_ID")

Equipment$ID <- as.factor(Equipment$ID) 
Equipment$Type <- as.factor(Equipment$Type)
Equipment$Lab_ID <- as.factor(Equipment$Lab_ID)

```

```{r}

## How many labs are there?

levels(Equipment$Lab_ID)
  # 13 labs

## Checking for missing values

colMeans(is.na(Equipment))*100
  # no missing values

is.na(Equipment$Type)
  # missing values can be seen in the table but are not showing up here

levels(Equipment$Type)
  # only two types shown, Gilson Pipetmax, Gilson Platemaster

empty_string_count <- sum(Equipment$Type == "")

print(empty_string_count)
total_rows <- nrow(Equipment)

(empty_string_count / total_rows) * 100

  # 299 of 386 rows empty in Type column
  # 77.46% data for Equipment Type missing

## Amount of equipment present in each lab

table(Equipment$Lab_ID)

# Checking for unique equipment

a <- Equipment %>% group_by(Lab_ID) %>% 
  summarise(Unique_Equipment_Count = n_distinct(Name))

a

sum(a$Unique_Equipment_Count)
 # 299 unique equipment

# Table of equipment used in each lab and its frequency

b <- Equipment %>% group_by(Lab_ID, Name) %>% summarise(Frequency = n())

b
